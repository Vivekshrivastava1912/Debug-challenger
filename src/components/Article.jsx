                    is a creative and engaging platform built to help
                    programmers sharpen one of the most important software
                    skills ‚Äî debugging. Unlike traditional learning platforms
                    that focus only on problem-solving, this platform encourages
                    a unique mindset: thinking like a developer, not just a
                    coder.

                    seen in industry-level projects.
